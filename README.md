# temporal-diagrams-demo via Gradle and Ji
Compile temporal-diagrams-demo with gradle and jitpack dependencies

- https://github.com/mcanlas/temporal-diagrams
- https://jitpack.io/#mcanlas/temporal-diagrams

# Why

At work we have a jitpack mirror in our artifactory and we use Gradle for Scala.

Its easier for us to consume the lib from jitpack than from github through the firewall.
